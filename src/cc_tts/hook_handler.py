"""Stop hook handler for auto-read mode.

This hook fires on EVERY Claude response (registered as a Stop hook in
hooks/hooks.json via the cc-voice plugin). It is intentionally always-registered rather than
dynamically added/removed because CC hooks don't hot-reload — they require
a session restart to take effect.

The cost is negligible when auto_read = false (the default): the handler
loads config, sees auto_read is off, and exits immediately (~200ms Python
startup, no audio processing). Only when auto_read = true does it extract
the assistant's response and speak it.

Performance: the handler forks immediately after extracting the text. The
parent exits (~100ms) so CC unblocks and accepts the next user input. The
child process synthesizes and plays audio in the background. This means
the user can type while the previous response is still being spoken.

Latency: batch mode — speaks AFTER the full response is generated, not
during. For streaming TTS (sentence-by-sentence as Claude types), use the
PTY wrapper instead: `make run_voice_stream` / `cc-tts-wrap claude`. Do
not enable both simultaneously or you'll get double speaking.
